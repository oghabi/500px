# MNIST-adversarial-images
Create adversarial images to fool a MNIST classifier in TensorFlow

## A Tech Challenge
**Backstory**
The original concept of this notebook was based on a Machine Learning tech challenge from the Toronto startup [500px](https://500px.com). 

**The Challenge**
Create adversarial images to fool a MNIST classifier in TensorFlow. Specifically, pick 10 images of digit ‘2’ which are correctly classified as ‘2’ by the trained model and generate adversarial images so the network incorrectly classifies them as 6.

**The Challenge**
The code and the results are shown in this [notebook](https://github.com/oghabi/500px/blob/master/500px.ipynb).
