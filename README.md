## GAN-MNIST-Adversarial-Images
Create adversarial images to fool a MNIST classifier in TensorFlow. Pick 10 images of digit ‘2’ which are correctly classified as ‘2’ by the trained model and generate adversarial images so the network incorrectly classifies them as 6.

## Dataset
[MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

## Results
The code and the results are shown in this [notebook](https://github.com/oghabi/500px/blob/master/500px.ipynb).
